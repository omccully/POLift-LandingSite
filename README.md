Landing page for the POLift mobile app. Landing page is made using Bootstrap.

POLift has many innovative features not commonly found in most workout apps: 

- Plate math: for barbell exercises, the app will display which plates to use based on the weight
- Rest timer: when submitting results for an exercise, a rest timer will automatically start. The timer length can be customized based on which exercise is being done.
- Progress graphs
- Warmup routine
- Tracks exercise weight and automatically increases weight over time based on user-defined rules
